By the help of react we can break our code into modular components.
---

# WHY React?
- We can use states which means that once we update the state variable it changes across the page.
- We can split our app into multiple components and reuse those components.

- React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI <!-- without Re-rendering whole page,-->  which is better than updating content using real DOM 

- Debugging and Maintainance is easy.


TO create react app:
---


```
Eg:

'npx create-react-app with-react'

Syntax:
'npx create-react-app Folder_Name'
Folder_Name- is potional



  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd with-react
  npm start
  ```



------------------------

To run server of React:
---
```
'npm run dev'
```

Note:
---

```
- Every code of react is present in 'src' directory
- In 'public' directory images and other static files are stored. '/filename' is used to access data of 'public' directory.

- '.jsx' file extension

- in React 'class' is referred as 'className'
- State- Ek aisa variable jise hum DOM mein use kar payein aur change kar paain

- Inside return block of 'App.js' {} denotes the code of Java Script
```
